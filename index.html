            <p>
                Your work is not exactly the same than your colleagues. You need different data for your own tasks. With
                misocell, you can customize all your display to fulfill your exact requirements. And no need of compromise,
                each member of your team has its own interface.

            <p>
                Adding columns, re-ordering form fields, removing unsignificant decimals or hide some meaningless data is
                a simple and efficient process. In a few clicks, edit your screens and get a real-time rendering.

            <p>
                Big list of numbers are hard to read and cumbersome to interpret. Generally, we export the data
                into a spreadsheet software and use its advanced chart features. That's just work. But at each update,
                your file is obsolete, and you need to re-import them.
            </p>
            <p>
                misocell assists you in turning your data into nice interactive visualizations directly into your browser.
                No more data desynchronization: misocell works on the original and fresh data. And,
                icing on the cake, you can embed these charts into your next meeting slideshows, as you did before.

                You probably use some open-source softwares or third-part applications. Social networks, Content Management
                Systems (CMS), or Entreprise Resource Planning (ERP) softwares... Mixing data between all these datasources
                is often synonym of a long and tiresome export/import dance, including an important error factor and some
                outdated data probability.

                misocell already supports a wide range of datasources out of the box. Plug your Customer Relationship Manager

                As a Human Resources Manager, I often switch between our ERP and LinkedIn to track new talents or update
                our prospect data. It was really time consuming and error-prone, as I had to manually edit all candidate
                information. misocell helped me a lot in my daily tasks, even providing a far more beautiful UI of our
                1990's looked software.

                As a freelance, I charge my customers on hourly base. I used to using Trello as a todo-list, Toggl to
                track the time spent on each task, and a small private billing software to edit and send my invoices.
            </p>
            <p>
                misocell brought the glu between all these three tools, providing me a straightforward workflow to bill my
                customers through a single nice-looking interface. It saved me so much time! Thanks a lot for your products!

                I co-founded a web entreprise and I am in charge of all the marketing tasks. To straighten out our business,
                I have to get fresh data from our sales. As we gave priority to new features and customer support, I learnt to
                use PHPMyAdmin, an developer-centered admin panel. Not very adapted to my daily work, but I can export my data
                to Excel, visualize it, and eventually updating them before re-importing them into database.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was a stressful experience, as it sometimes crushed the entire site, because of some humane errors in
                some developer-only languages. Plugging in misocell on our infrastructure was really simple, and out of the box
                I was able to monitor my business with simple charts, always up-to-date. Their team is definitively a start-up helper!
